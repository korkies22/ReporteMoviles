                        Therefore, anyone who enters in the application can load the game</p>

                        the app should verify if the current user is the same user as the one playing. This way, the app could have multiple plays for different users at the same time too.</p>

                        <p class="plan__feature">For example, all of the paying for the premium suscription is handled by Google play services. 
                            This prevents us from messing with the payment system of the premium feature and therefore this feature is considered very secure</p>

                            <p class="plan__feature">Something unexpected, was that when we tried to login with Facebook on the unsinged apk, the above error appeared.
                                It looks like the login with Facebook feature is also protected with some kind of hash key which refers to something not available in the decompiled application.
                                This adds another layer of security to the app as it is not possible to fake the app and stole the user data without them noticing it.

                            This is, to verify that the place from the request origin has a Hash or some sort of key which certifies that the origin of the application is only the apps developed by the team.</p>
