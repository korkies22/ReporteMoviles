			 <h1 class="section-title">Methodology</h1>
			 <p class="image_chess--textAdded">Five methods were applied to measure performance in the application. First the GPU usage in the Android developer options was used. The entire app was navigated with special attention in the spikes present in the graphics and then we analyzed if those spikes had a critical impact on the app or not.
                 Then, we analyzed the overdraw in the application looking for areaas with a big amount of red color (which meant a high overdraw) and search the reasons for it.
                 Later, we made a check with the Android profiling monitor and try to look for parts of the application with Memory leaks.
                 After that, we reviewed the code in order to find Threading usage and analyze if they were properly implemented.
                 Finally, we reviewed the code in order to find Caching usage and analyze if the caching options selected were appropiated for the context of usage.

                    <p class="plan__feature">The gif show the GPU usage while navigating through the app. When the bars go above the green line, it means that the processing time took more than 16ms and then the screen couldn't render at the speed of time needed in order to avoid lagging. However, even if some bars over the green line appeared while using the application, they didn't last long. Also, this also happens at the beginning of the screen transition and for a very short time. This means that there is not a considerable problem</p>
<p class="plan__feature">Another thing to notice, is that even during a game, when there is need to render the table and the moves, there is not GUI lagging and the app runs very smooth</p>

                    <h1 class="plan__title">Why is this happening?</h1>
                    <p class="plan__feature">In general, the application makes a good usage of threads. For every possible expensive piece of code that the app has to run, a thread is used to the application is very smooth</p>

                    <p class="plan__feature">For most parts of the application, there is no considerable overdraw. As mentioned previously, the app runs very smooth. Only the titles show a bit of overdraw but this is due to the title being changed every time the user changes a tab</p>

                    <p class="plan__feature">There is not a single Class which overrides onDraw. Therefore this method is only used to paint the native components as it should be. Some layouts have a background though. But this are only for style purposes and the background are simple colors or simple gradients</p>

                    <p class="plan__feature">In the MenuItem class found in the View Package, the drawer is defined. Here every time a Fragment is changed (the user clicks on something on the tab) the drawer is set to Highlight and the to remove Highlight. This makes some weird loops around the options available in the drawer which accounts for a lot of overdraw</p>
					<h1 class="plan__title">What should they do?</h1>
					<img class="image_code" src="images/highlight_changes.png"/>  
					<p class="plan__feature">In the same method they should include one attribute and change the highlight methods. This way of highlighting and then remove the highlight from every MenuItem makes a little style change, but also may have a big impact on performance. If a cellphone is not very powerful, then the opening and closing of the drawer creates some uncomfortable lagging</p>
					<p class="plan__feature">The proposed change is therefore to highlight only one MenuItem at a time, this will create only overdraw in one item which is something manageable in general</p>

                        <p class="plan__feature">In the doMove method in the EngineConnection class found in the playzone/engine/model package, the app receives a move from the user and then selects the move to make. This involves complex algorithms and therefore it is a good idea to use a thread in the case.</p>
                        <p class="plan__feature">The lintern here shows a message informing of a potential leak, due to being an internal class of the EngineConnection class. However, the engine connection class itself does not have a reference to the activity nor to any other fragment (and the class has not a lifecycle), so having a thread that runs in the background creates no leaks.</p>
                        <p class="plan__feature">Finally, in the post execute they call a method of the class they're in, which later uses an Interface to send the reponse back. So again, no leak present</p>

                        <p class="plan__feature">It is also worth noticing that in the onPostExecute method the app verifies that the request is not cancelled, and that the attribute that it want to access is not null, which may happens due to the view being destroyed</p>

                            <p class="plan__feature">For general http requests, the app uses a created class called HTTPAsyn, this class is in charge of handling asynchronous http requests.</p>
                            <p class="plan__feature">The way it does it is by using an Executor with the execute method and a Handler with the post method. This delegates the call to another thread and thus the main Thread is not blocked</p>
                            <p class="plan__feature">However, we think that even if this is a good strategy for HTTP calls, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. For example the volley library is also a good strategy for managing asynchronous http calls, and avoid the work of mantaining the library in the future</p>
                            <p class="plan__feature">Another performance tactic used in this custom class, is that instead of doing String concatenation with classic Strings, they use String builders. This is a little Microoptimization (taking into account the length of the Strings) but still it is a practice worth of doing</p>
