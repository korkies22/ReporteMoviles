                        <li>The first package is in charge of storing the Activities, Fragments, animations and the drawing of the board</li>
                        <li>The second package is in charge of handling the login of a match and other util classes like an Asynchronous custom HTTP request class.</li>
                        <li>The third package is a socketio library, in charge of handling the online matches and warn the user if it lost the connection during a match.</li>
                        <li>Finally, the fourth package is in charge of handling a Service for the login behind the matches. That is, when the user choose to play a match, the app launches a Service to handle in background all heavy tasks, mainly related to the logic of the game. This library is based on a popular OS library and it is made in C++, therefore is beyond the reach of this report.</li>
